Gomoku

Created a gomoku game with the help of my partner for my computer architecture class. The purpose of the game is to get 5 spots in a row (diagonally, 
straight across, and down/up). Made extensive use of certain MIPS features such as specific syscalls for sound, jal/jr instruction and MIPS strings to help
create a fully functioning Gomoku game.
